# palette_swapper
The plan is for this to be all client-side, and all major computations take place in the browser.  I'm using node and Express for convenience, though.

## Libraries used
* DeltaE from http://zschuessler.github.io/DeltaE/
* AnyPalette.js from https://www.npmjs.com/package/anypalette
* D3 Color from https://github.com/d3/d3-color
* underscorejs from https://underscorejs.org/
* PureCSS from https://purecss.io/ (though I haven't done much with it yet)

Also thanks to this [gist](https://gist.github.com/walfie/a80c4432bcff70fb826d5d28158e9cc4) for the local release version.
